# Mortgage calculator app

This is a small personal project that aided me in ditermining how much monthyl payments would be with different sized mortgages.

You can visit the live site here for view: https://luke-goodridge.github.io/Mortgage-Calculator/

Alternatively you can clone the repro and run `NPM START` in order to run this locally.

Should be all mobile resposive too. 

This was one of my first react apps, really enjoyed the experience and hope to make more complex apps soon.
